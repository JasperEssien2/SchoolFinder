# SchoolFinder
Is an app that helps you find schools either close to you, or in a specified region/state or country. School Finders uses gradle to organize 
the app into two flavors regular users and school owners flavor. The school owner flavor is for school owners where they can register and upload images
and details of their school including but not limited to certificates and achievements, courses offered, classes/department and their respective head teachers profile.
This app helps those schools 
by making them public not only to individuals in their community but to the world, this app gives them the opportunity to show the world how much 
competent they are, by uploading images of their structure, details about the school, academic achievements, qualifications, how qualified their
teachers are etc, they can also get updates on how the world rate them. For parents and students ans other users, this app helps them to search schools not only close to them but in their state or country of
choice, they can also view the school details and rate the school and also apply.

## Motivation
This is the my personal project of the udacity nanodegree for android program. This app targets schools, parent, schools, guardians. 
Noticing most nice and standard coming up schools being overshadowed by popular schools and the growing needs for parents, guardians and
student to get the best school made me to start this project.
